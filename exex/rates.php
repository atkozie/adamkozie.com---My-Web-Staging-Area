<h2>Rates</h2>

<p>Like most recording facilites, we don't publish our rates online. This is because all projects are different and there is no one-size-fits-all approach to pricing them. However, we're passionate about recording and we pride ourselves on flexibility. We want to make your project a reality, and we will work with you on pricing toward that end. Hourly, daily and weekly rates are availabe. <a href="contact.php">Contact us</a> and we'll be happy to get a quote going for you.</p>
