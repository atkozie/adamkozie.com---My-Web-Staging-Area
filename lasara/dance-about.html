<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>I have been dancing as long as I can remember. I attended an arts-based high school which required me to teach regular classes as a part of my own education. I've been teaching one thing or another since I was 13 years old, and this lucky experience has bred in me a natural, instinctive presence in the classroom. I hold a BFA in Dance from Cornish College of the Arts (class of 2003).</p><br />
<p>I am inspired by teachers from all traditions, including Sally Carley, Jenny Hayo, Beth Award, Miguel Gutierrez, Pina Bausch, Bill T. Jones, Amii LeGendre, Tere O’Connor, and Sol Alberione.<br /> <br /></p>

<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>Above all aesthetic subjectivity, I value loving and being yourself. I am deeply and continually committed to inclusivity, authenticity and empathy in everything I do, and my dance classes become a powerful outlet for this commitment. I love making people powerful through my teaching.<br /><br /></p>

<h3>DanceMob</h3>
<p>DanceMob is a follow-along dance party created by me. The lights are dark and the soundtrack is rad (think pop, hip hop and a little jazz funk). DanceMob is f*cking fun. Students are encouraged to bail on their inhibitions and let loose. The vibe is welcoming and down to earth. All genders, ages, body types, orientations and dance abilities show up to get down together. DanceMob is what you make it. Rest when you need, dance your A$$ off, do the moves or don’t! Dance bigger than you ever knew you could!No dance experience required.</p><br />

<h3>Zumba®</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.zumba.com/en-US" >Zumba®</a> is a dance fitness format that takes the "work" out of workout, by mixing low-intensity and high-intensity moves for an interval-style, calorie-burning dance fitness party. Once the Latin and World rhythms take over, you'll see why Zumba® Fitness classes are often called exercise in disguise. Super effective? Check. Super fun? Check and check. </p><br />

<p>I am a trained and certified Zumba® instructor since 2012.</p><br /><br />
