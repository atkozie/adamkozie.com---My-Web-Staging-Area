<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>I have practiced Yoga for many years, and at times it feels like it has saved my life. I received my 200-hour certification through 8 Limbs Yoga Centers in Seattle in 2010, and began teaching at several 8 Limbs Yoga locations in Seattle soon after. I began teaching Yoga at Community Fitness in Roosevelt in 2012.<br /><br /></p>

<h3>Philosophy</h3>

<p>On the mat as on the stage, my focus is on the imperishable big questions: Who and why are we? How can we get more comfortable here in this moment? Is it possible to embody an abstract and creative spiritual practice with steadfastness? Why are we always so embarrassed of ourselves and how can we be brave enough to let what resides inside of us show up outside of us? I believe both the Yoga mat and the performance stage are excellent laboratories for self-inquiry.</p><br />

<p>With a wealth of movement experience, I incorporate elements from many movement methodologies into my classes. I enjoy building fun sequences that connect breath to body and build coordination. Physically we get stronger and more flexible  gaining ability to balance, even while generating momentum. With attention, these elements grow in our character as well. With humor and enthusiasm, I bring a down-to-earth accessibility to my teaching, as well as a total reverence for the practice. I attended an arts-based high school which required me to teach regular classes as a part of my own education. So I've been teaching one thing or another since I was 13 years old, and this lucky experience bred my natural and instinctive presence in the class room.</p><br />

<p>My most cherished and influential teachers from the Yogic tradition include Melina Meza, Chiara Guerrieri, Jenny Hayo, Anne Phyfe Palmer, Beth Award and Sally Carley.</p><br />

<p>Yoga continues to transform me in sneaky, graceful ways.</p><br />
