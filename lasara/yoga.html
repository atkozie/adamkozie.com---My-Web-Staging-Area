"From the ground up, I was going to detox my personality of any and everything that someone else put there without my blessing."<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Eddie Huang<br /> <br /> <br />"I have been fortunate enough to be a Yoga student of Lasara Jarvis for about a year now. In addition to teaching the many things that are encompassed by the term Yoga, i.e. stretching, strengthening and exploration of the self, I have found her to be a great teacher. Lasara is insightful and makes me feel at ease with myself and the world around me. Her acceptance of me and my idiosyncrasies has helped me to be more accepting of myself and brought me to a place of greater peace in the world. The wisdom and warmth she brings to each session are a great offering and help me to be more grounded."<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-D.C., student<br />
